# GBIF data access using R

## Session 6: Mapping GBIF data in R

* https://github.com/ropensci/mapr
* Hijmans (2016) Spatial data analysis and modelling with R http://www.rspatial.org/
* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/vignettes/Raster.pdf


## Workshop training materials

 * [Some mapping tools and hints](mapping.md) >> [Rmd script](mapping.Rmd)


## Excercises

 * Select a species (or species group) and make a simple map zoomed in to your home city, using an appropriate bounding box.
 * Make a leaflet map of the same occurrence data selection.
 * **EXTRA**: Re-project your occurrence data points to the appropriate UTM zone for your home city, and map together with one of the Bioclim environment layers (remember to reproject both the occurrences and the bioclim layer - to the same CRS).
