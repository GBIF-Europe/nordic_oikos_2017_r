# Nordic Oikos 2018 -- GBIF data with R

Scientific reuse of openly published biodiversity information: Programmatic access to and analysis of primary biodiversity information using R. Nordic Oikos 2018, pre-conference R workshop, 18th and 19th February 2018 in Trondheim, Norway.

## Session 4: Download event core data from GBIF

This session gives a brief introduction to what "event" data is, why it mathers and how to access this datatype. 

1. Brief introduction to event-core and event data
2. Download and data-wrangling 
3. Usage example

We will give an gentle introduction to event type, or sample based data. This is a rather new datatype in GBIF and not all functionality for usage through the API are in place. Hence, we will show how to find relevant data, extract datasetIDs and download directly raw data from the IPT.
