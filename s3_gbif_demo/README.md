# Nordic Oikos 2018 -- GBIF data with R

Scientific reuse of openly published biodiversity information: Programmatic access to and analysis of primary biodiversity information using R. Nordic Oikos 2018, pre-conference R workshop, 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> February 2018 in Trondheim, Norway.

## Session 3: Download occurrence data from GBIF in R

This session presents programmatic access to GBIF data using R with focus on the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) [rgbif-package](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif). We will also explore the [taxize](https://ropensci.org/tutorials/taxize_tutorial/) R-package for handling taxon names.

* Introduction to [rgbif](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif) ([tutorial](https://ropensci.org/tutorials/rgbif_tutorial/))
* Filtering using data terms (and spatial geometry)
* Taxon names / resolving (using taxize). What is "nubkey‚Äù?
* Asynchron download
