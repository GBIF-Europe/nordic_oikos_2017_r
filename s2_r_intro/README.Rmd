# GBIF data access using R

## Session 2: Introduction to R, RStudio, GitHub

*Prerequisite*: Bring your own laptop with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed and be familiar with the very basics of [R scripting](http://www.rspatial.org/intr/index.html). 

Session 2 will cover getting started by recommending specific stacks of software and tools for working with geospatial analysis in R. It will cover installation procedures for packages used in during the workshop and it will also recommend a selection of various online training resources including some resources that support intermediate and advanced use beyond simple R scripts, for example:

 * [RStudio IDE Essentials Primer](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-part-1/)
 * [Guidelines for R package development](https://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)
 * [Guidelines for Advanced R](https://adv-r.had.co.nz/)
