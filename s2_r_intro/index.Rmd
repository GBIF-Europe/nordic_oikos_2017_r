## Session 2: Quick intro to R, RStudio, GitHub

Session will cover getting started - installing recommended software and tools, installation procedures for some relevant packages used in some of the upcoming sessions - for working with _*geospatial data analysis*_ in R. 

The session will also suggest a few _*online learning resources*_ for intermediate and advanced use beyond simple R scripts - including training resources to help when building packages for data and web apps and workflows for international collaboration.

## Topics

- Before work - How can you get it all onto your laptop? 
- What "stack" for R along with an IDE and other trimmings is normally needed for working with geospatial data?
- What is git and GitHub and how can you use workflows like [GitFlow](https://guides.github.com) to collaborate with others?

If time permits, also some usage example:

- A function for Automated [Downloads of Event Data from GBIF.org](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/search?type=SAMPLING_EVENT)
- The path from an R script towards a function in a package?
- R-based web service serving synthetic geodata

# Installing your stack

There are *different ways to get started* with everything you need onto your laptop:

1. Easiest/ SaaS - Use The Cloud and a Web Browser
1. Traditional Non-Isolated - Manual Interactive Steps
1. Traditional Isolated VM - Semi-Automated Steps
1. Modern / FOSS - Use Docker

## Different ways to get started:

*Easiest / SaaS* - Log in to a [remote server](https://mirroreum.bioatlas.se ) (convenient -  requires only a login/pass) where everything has been set up already.

- Convenient, but ... "Software As A Service" has drawbacks
- Cloud Server - No Offline Work Possible
- You Often Cannot Fix Remote Issues
- Closed data (not yet published) gets shared with service provider
- How do you connect to local data?

## Different ways to get started:

*"Traditional Non-Isolated"* - Do a tradional manual installation of all software components step-by-step along with various adaptations required depending on the OS used (Windows, Mac, Linux etc). Non-isolated = it is mixed up with other stuff on your laptop.

- Manual Interactive Steps
- Not Portable - "it works (only?) on my machine"
- Troubleshooting system library installation issues - read manuals or search the Internets :)
- How Can You Share or Run Your Work Reproducibly On Another Host?

## Different ways to get started:

*"Traditional Isolated - VM"* - Create a VM - Virtual Machine - for example using VirtualBox - by launching an instance of a FOSS OS and run a script to install all required dependencies.

1. Download a recent [Linux Mint](http://ftp.portlane.com/pub/os/linux/linuxmint/stable/18.3/linuxmint-18.3-xfce-64bit.iso) (Linux Mint uses Debian or Ubuntu package bases) or equivalent OS, see <https://distrowatch.com/> for popularity rankings
1. Get [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and launch an instance of this [ISO in VirtualBox](http://techooid.com/install-linux-mint-virtual-machine) - configure VirtualBox to use bridged networking
1. Log in an run an [install script]() to get everything in a hopefully automated, reproducible, non-interactive way, "semi-deterministic" but not "immutable"
1. Copy the whole unit (.vmdk) [to another server](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tr-dojo/clone-and-move-virtual-machines-in-virtualbox/) if you wish


## Different ways to get started:

*Modern / FOSS* - Pull image(s) with all required prepackaged software from Docker Hub (requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)) and launch it locally. The `docker` command is like `git` but not for code but for software packages (portable binaries, but can also [be used for datasets](https://hub.docker.com/r/bioatlas/backbone/tags/)!) - use `docker push` to publish and `docker pull` to use (versioned) images from the [DockerHub](https://dockerhub.com).

- Fast, Versioned and Up-To-Date
- Permits Offline Work
- FOSS software :) - you can use local data and build from source!

## Modern Setup - Steps

This gives an official "stack" with most things needed for geospatial data analysis work:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
docker run -d --name mywebide \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  --publish 8787:8787 \
  --volume $(pwd):/home/rstudio \
  rocker/geospatial

firefox http://localhost:8787 &
```

This 5G image [extends the above stack]() with additional R packages:

```bash
    docker pull bioatlas/mirroreum
```

## Traditional Setup - Manual steps

1. Install R (>= v3.0) possibly with Rtools (if on Windows OS) from <https://cran.rstudio.com/>
1. Install RStudio from <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>
1. Install various packages - which packages do you need? - including [system libraries](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned/blob/master/r-dependencies.md) - and hunt for dependencies, sometimes resolving issues, conflicts etc by [searching the Internets for solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44973639/trouble-installing-sf-due-to-gdal)
1. Customize your setup. For example, with RStudio, edit your *.Rprofile* in your home directory to override relevant settings/options, for example with the ALA4R package you could use [these settings](https://gist.github.com/mskyttner/146b8d76013bbf790b3c6957f73e32ee) to override [these default options](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ALA4R/blob/master/R/onload.R)

## Working with geospatial data

For doing [geospatial data analysis work](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) in general and in particular for being able to work with data from [GBIF](https://gbif.org) and [various related data sources](https://living-atlases.gbif.org/), this is a recommended software "stack":

- R + RStudio + [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (if on Windows OS)
- R packages that supports [geospatial work](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial/)
- System libraries (depends on OS) such as [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) and [TeX](https://tug.org/texlive/) etc
- R packages that provide access to [GBIF]() and related data sources [such as ALA4R](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ALA4R) and various [tools to support reproducible research](https://ropensci.org/packages/)

## Which packages do you need?

    # use grep in the repo for strings library and require, ex:
    # rgrep "library" | grep -oP "library\(.*?\)" | sort -u | uniq
    
```r
    install.packages(c(
      "rgbif", "rstudioapi", "ALA4R",  # data access
      "tidyverse", "plyr", "rio", "stringr", # wrangling   
      "DT", "gapminder", "plotly", "RColorBrewer", # visuals
      "spocc", "rgeos", "rgdal", "mapproj", "maps", 
      "maptools", "raster", "mapr",  # geospatial
      "ape", "phytools"  # phylogenetic tools
    ))
```

What packages do you have?

```bash
    R -e "cat(rownames(installed.packages()))"
    # use setdiff() to see what you're missing?
```

## Using git, GitHub, GitFlow

The `git` tool allows decentralized asynchronous collaboration across individuals and teams by managing different versions of sets of files (often code).

This tool supports a workflow, increasingly standardized and [known as "GitFlow"](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), to merge so called "Pull Requests" or "Merge Request" which combine different contributions from various individuals allowing changes or branches to evolve into new master versions.

## Solo work or team work?

The `git` command and GitFlow workflow can be used locally by a single user because it allows to track changes and allows reverting to earlier versions etc. 

It is also really useful at scale - for example when collaborating with several other colleagues. It enables synching changes from remote repositories into your local repos by pulling from [GitHub](https://github.com) - a site where open source code can be stored and citable code can be [published](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) at no cost.

##  Publish a web page from CLI with git and the "gh-pages" branch

If you [use the CLI to push](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) HTML files to a branch you name ["gh-pages"](https://pages.github.com/), it will [appear on the Internet](https://GBIF-Europe.github.io/nordic_oikos_2018_r/s2_r_intro)

```bash
    # start a new git repo in a local directory
    apt install git
    mkdir -p ~/repos/myrepo && cd ~/repos/myrepo
    git init
    
    # add content and push to remote repo
    git add index.Rmd
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git remote add origin \
      git@github.com:GBIF-Europe/nordic_oikos_2018_r.git
    git push --set-upstream origin master
```
## ...continued...

```bash
    # knit a .Rmd in RStudio and get a .html file
    git checkout -b gh-pages
    git add index.html
    git commit -m "add webpage"
    
    # publish by pushing HTML-file to gh-pages branch
    git push -u origin gh-pages
    
    # verify that the web page is there
    firefox https://gbif-europe.github.io/nordic_oikos_2018_r/s2_r_intro
    
```

## Using the RStudio IDE UI toolbar with git and GitHub

There are UIs for example in RStudio for working with local and remote repositories (for example at GitHub) that abstract away some steps that always also can be done using `git` at the CLI. 

Setting up RStudio for using `git` and GitHub requires using the GIT icon from the RStudio toolbar but first you need to do some [initial setup in RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) - richly [documented in excellent ways](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/collaboration-and-time-travel-version-control-with-git-github-and-rstudio/) in many places if you search the Internets.
